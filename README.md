One-click-updater
=================

Update your server within 5 seconds!

## What is this?

With these scripts you can get the latest spigot.jar/bungeecord.jar from ci.md_5.net

## Requirements

* You MUST run a linux os on the server you're hosting your proxy/minecraft server on.

## How do I use it?

####I want to update spigot only:
Then use __update_spigot.sh__.<br>
You don't need to change anythin<g.<br>Just put the file in your spigot directory.<br>
Run the script by executing `./update_spigot.sh` in the terminal.

####I want to update bungeecord only:
Then use __update_bungeecord.sh__.<br>
You don't need to change anything.<br>Just put the file in your bungeecord directory.<br>
Run the script by executing `./update_bungee.sh` in the terminal.

####I want to update both spigot and bungeecord:
Then use __update_everything.sh__.<br>
Before you do this you need to edit the destination paths for your bungeecord and spigot directory since it's unlikely that it's the same on your server as on mine.
When you've replaced the path with YOUR server's path drop the file in a easy accesible folder.<br>
Run the script by executing `./update_everything.sh` in the terminal.
